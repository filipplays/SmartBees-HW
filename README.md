# SmartBees - hardware

This repository contains all of the hardware files required to replicate the SmartBees project.
The project, developed by the Faculty of Electrical Engineering in Ljubljana and the Jo≈æef Stefan Institute, enables smart homes for wild bees. 

The hardware platform includes sensors for:
- air quality, pressure, humidity and temperature (BME680).
- Light intensity (Adafruit photoresistor 161).
- Sound (2x SPH0645LM4H-1-8).
- Acceleration (ADXL335BCPZ-RL7).

Along with the hardware platform the team developed the firmware, LoRaWAN communication methodology, the user interface, and an AI model to analyse the sounds captured from the microphones on the edge.
